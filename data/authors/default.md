At the moment, I'm developing my skills in AI by building projects.

My interests change often but I usually like writing, talking about philosophy, working with tools and design, coding,
and playing chess.

I also write sometimes [here](https://cryptocache.substack.com)
And I like [talking](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC35sWEJj8pgzdHE4FlpZOsA) about the things I find interesting
I have a [newsletter](https://anyasingh.substack.com) where you can connect with me every month
