Hi, I'm Anya! Thanks for stopping by. Here's a bit more about me and what's consuming me these days:

I like asking questions, thinking critically about the world by reading, and frequently reflecting (still working on this). I strive to be supportive, positive, and the type of person who does things. 

<h4> What am I up to now? </h4>

I'm on a research sprint for the next few months to learn about energy and poverty cycles in rural Africa with the aim to write a whitepaper on a framework for NPOs to maximize their return per dollar with Solar4Africa. Also enjoying [writing problem memos](https://www.notion.so/anyasingh/Memo-Agricultural-food-waste-from-farms-in-rural-India-e18fa87799e2430886249d968dee2a72). Playing tennis too.
