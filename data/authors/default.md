Hi, I'm Anya! Thanks for stopping by. Here's a bit more about me and what's consuming me these days:

I like asking questions and talking to new people. I read a fair bit also - check out my [bookshelf](anyasingh.com/bookshelf)

I feel my most creative and thoughtful being physically active - running, climbing, skiing, swimmming. I'm usually up (and very excited) for new adventures.

<h4> What am I up to now? </h4>
i'm still figuring out what I want to work on next. for now, learning to become a better engineer.
