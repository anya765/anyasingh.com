hi, i'm anya! more about me and what's consuming me these days:

i like asking questions and talking to new people. I enjoy the process of going deep into unknown technical fields.

i feel my most creative and thoughtful being physically active - running, climbing, skiing, swimmming, playing tennis. i'm usually up for (and very excited about) new adventures.

<h4> what am i up to now? </h4>
i'm learning to be a better engineer.
